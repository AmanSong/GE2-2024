## Assignment Title: "EDEN"

## Brief 

Your task is to observe and record birds, insects, nematodes bacteria or any living creatures, and simulate it, artistly or realistically using a game engine. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/skooter500/miniature-rotary-phone) and use the examples for steering behaviors and state machines in your project.

EDEN Will be Exhibited at Audio Garden Festival in August

## Deliverables     

Photographs/videos of your primary research. Go into nature, find something interesting and photograph/video it. You can store your research in a photo gallery and link to it from your git repo.

- Fork one of the starter code repos and study the examples
- Use the code and examples to create a visual simulation that models something you observed from your primary research. Birds flying, fish swimming, toads jumping, plants growing, a creature eating another creature, reproduction, cell growth, nematodes, your dog, bed bugs, paratites, your family members.
- A user interface that allows you to change parameters on the simulation and observe the effects on the simulation
- A brief comparission of your observations versus the simulation
- A demo video, assignmentreadmefile in the the correct format
