## Assignment Title: "Bird Watching"


## Brief 

Your task is to observe and record birds, insects, nematodes or any living creatures, and simulate what you observe, artistly  or realistically using a game engine. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/skooter500/miniature-rotary-phone) and use the examples for steering behaviors and state machines in your project.

## Deliverables     

Photographs/videos of your primary research. Go into nature, find something interesting and photograph/video it. You can store your research in a photo gallery and link to it from your git repo.

A working simulation that simulates something from your primary research.

A demo video demo

## Marking Scheme:

Visuals:

0-10 points: The quality of the visual design of the game, including the aesthetics, clarity, and coherence of the visual elements. Higher marks will be awarded for games  with well-designed graphics that complement and enhance the emergent behaviors of the artificial life forms.

Complexity:

0-20 points: The degree of complexity and sophistication of the emergent behaviors generated by the game engine. Higher marks will be awarded for game engines that produce a wide range of interesting and surprising behaviors, and that demonstrate a deep understanding of the mathematical and computational principles underlying emergent systems.

Novelty:

0-15 points: The degree of novelty and originality in the design of the game. Higher marks will be awarded for games that explore new and innovative approaches to simulating life, and that demonstrate a creative use of the themes

Anthropomorphic qualities:

0-15 points: The degree to which the artificial life forms exhibit anthropomorphic qualities, such as the ability to learn, adapt, and communicate. Higher marks will be awarded for game engines that create artificial life forms that are complex, diverse, and capable of interacting with their environment in interesting and creative ways. Also higher marks will be awarded for life forms that evoke an emotional connection with the player - be it empathy, awe, compassion, love. 

Overall quality & Documentation:

0-40 points: An overall assessment of the quality of the game engine, taking into account all of the above criteria. This score will reflect the degree to which the game engine successfully explores the themes of the assignment and creates a compelling and engaging simulation of artificial life.


Total: 0-100 points.
